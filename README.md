# To-Do List Project

A simple and user-friendly To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from their list.
- **Local Storage**: The app uses local storage to save tasks, so the list is preserved even after the browser is closed.

2. **Marking Tasks**: 
   - Click on a task to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will be crossed out.
